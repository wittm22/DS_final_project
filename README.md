## Boston Marathon Winners (Men and Women)
The Boston Marathon, the world's oldest marathon, is a prominent race that runners from all over the world travel afar to compete in. This 26.2 mile race started in 1897 and has taken place almost every year since then. I found datasets on Kaggle which contain the male and female winners from each year's Boston Marathon. The datasets include the name of the winner, they year in which he/she won, the country he/she is from, his/her finishing time, and the distance of the race in both miles and kilometers. 

By analyzing the datasets, I wanted to answer the following research questions:

-what is the average time distance between men and women?

-has marathon times overall decreased over time?

-ranking countries on how many boston marathon winners they have

-how many people have won the boston marathon multiple times?

-mean difference in finishing time after distance change


Methodology:
In order to analyze the datasets, I will be using python code in Juptyer Notebook. 
Some tools I will be using to create visualizations based off the dataset are NumPy, Seaborn, Pandas, and Matplotlib
